# Protocol Summary


This project is meant to be a permissionless way for users to swap assets between each other at a fair price. You can think of T-Swap as a decentralized asset/token exchange (DEX). 
T-Swap is known as an [Automated Market Maker (AMM)](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm) because it doesn't use a normal "order book" style exchange, instead it uses "Pools" of an asset. 
It is similar to Uniswap. To understand Uniswap, please watch this video: [Uniswap Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLu35sIqVTM)


# Disclaimer

I, Karan Preet Singh , made all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by me is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

# Findings
## High

### [H-1] Incorrect fee calculation in `TSwapPool::getInputAmountBasedOnOutput` function

**Description:** The `TSwapPool::getInputAmountBasedOnOutput` function is calculating the amount of input tokens a user should put to get the desired amount of output tokens. However , the function miscalculates the resulting amount resulting in charging higher fee. 


**Impact:** Protocol takes more fees than expected i.e. 

**Recommended Mitigation:**

```diff
    function getInputAmountBasedOnOutput(
        uint256 outputAmount,
        uint256 inputReserves,
        uint256 outputReserves
    )
        public
        pure
        revertIfZero(outputAmount)
        revertIfZero(outputReserves)
        returns (uint256 inputAmount)

    {
        return
-            ((inputReserves * outputAmount) * 10_000) /
+            ((inputReserves * outputAmount) * 1_000) /
            ((outputReserves - outputAmount) * 997);
    }
```

### [H-2] Lack of slippage protection in `TSwapPool::swapExactOutput` causes users to receive way few tokens

**Description:** The `swapExactOutput` doesn't include any slippage protection . this is similar to what is done in `TSwapPool::swapExactInput` , where the function specifies the `minOutputAmount` , the `swapExactOutput` function should specify a `maxInputAmount`.


**Impact:** If market condition change before the transaction , the user can get a worse much swap


**Proof of Code:** Here is a scenario for slippage
1. User places a order of 1 WETH for 100USDC
2. Market condition changes while the transaction is in the mempool and the price of 1WETH changes to 2000USDC
3. The transaction completes and the user ends up paying 2000USDC for a 1WETH instead of 1000USDC.


**Recommended Mitigation:** We should set a `maxInputAmount` so to avoid slippage

```diff
    function swapExactOutput(
        IERC20 inputToken,
+        uint256 maxInputAmount,
        IERC20 outputToken,
.
.
.
    {   
+        if(inputAmount > maxInputAmount) {
+            revert();
+        }
        uint256 inputReserves = inputToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 outputReserves = outputToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        inputAmount = getInputAmountBasedOnOutput(
            outputAmount,
            inputReserves,
            outputReserves
        );

        _swap(inputToken, inputAmount, outputToken, outputAmount);
    }
```

### [H-3] `TSwapPool::sellPoolTokens` mismatches input and output tokens causing the users to receive incorrect amount of tokens

**Description:** The `sellPoolTokens` is intended to sell poolTokens in exchange of WETH tokens. The user mentions the amount of poolTokens they are willing to sell as a parameter. However , the function miscalculates the swapped amount.

This is because the `swapExactInput` needs to be called instead `swapExactOutput`.

**Impact:** Users will swap the wrong amount of token which is severe disruption of protocol

**Recommended Mitigation:**
```diff
 function sellPoolTokens(
        uint256 poolTokenAmount
    ) external returns (uint256 wethAmount) {
        return
+        swapExactInput(i_poolToken , poolTokenAmount ,i_wethToken ,minWethToReceive , uint64(block.timestamp) );
-        swapExactOutput( i_poolToken, i_wethToken, poolTokenAmount, uint64(block.timestamp) );
    }
```
Additionally use deadline as well

### [H-4] In `TSwapPool::_swap` the extra tokens given to users after `SWAP_COUNT_MAX` breaks the protocol invariant of `x * y = k`

**Description:** The protocol follows a strict invariant of `x * y = k`. Where:
- `x` : The balance of poolToken.
- `y` : The balance of WETH.
- `k` : the constant product of the two balances.

The following block of code is responsible for the issue
```javascript
    swap_count++;
    if (swap_count >= SWAP_COUNT_MAX) {
        swap_count = 0;
        outputToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, 1_000_000_000_000_000_000);
    }
```

This means , that whenever the balances change in the protocol, the ratio between the two amounts should remain constant , hence the `k`. However , this is broken due to extra incentive in the `_swap` function after every `SWAP_COUNT_MAX` swaps leading to drainage of protocol funds overtime.

**Impact:** A user could maliciously drain the protocol of funds by doing a lot of swaps to gain that extra incentive

**Proof of Code:**


<details>
<summary>Proof Of Code </summary>

Place the following in `TSwapPoolTest`
```javascript
    function testInvariantBroken() public {
        vm.startPrank(liquidityProvider);
        weth.approve(address(pool),100e18);
        poolToken.approve(address(pool),100e18);
        pool.deposit(100e18, 100e18, 100e18, uint64(block.timestamp));
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 wethAmount = 1e17;

        vm.startPrank(user);
        poolToken.approve(address(pool),type(uint256).max);
        pool.swapExactOutput(poolToken, weth , wethAmount , uint64(block.timestamp));
        pool.swapExactOutput(poolToken, weth , wethAmount , uint64(block.timestamp));
        pool.swapExactOutput(poolToken, weth , wethAmount , uint64(block.timestamp));
        pool.swapExactOutput(poolToken, weth , wethAmount , uint64(block.timestamp));
        pool.swapExactOutput(poolToken, weth , wethAmount , uint64(block.timestamp));
        pool.swapExactOutput(poolToken, weth , wethAmount , uint64(block.timestamp));
        pool.swapExactOutput(poolToken, weth , wethAmount , uint64(block.timestamp));
        pool.swapExactOutput(poolToken, weth , wethAmount , uint64(block.timestamp));
        pool.swapExactOutput(poolToken, weth , wethAmount , uint64(block.timestamp));

        int256 startingYAfter9Swaps = int256(weth.balanceOf(address(pool)));
        int256 expectedDeltaY = int256(-1) *int256(wethAmount);

        pool.swapExactOutput(poolToken, weth , wethAmount , uint64(block.timestamp));
        vm.stopPrank();

        int256 endingYAfter10Swaps = int256(weth.balanceOf(address(pool)));
        int256 actualDeltaY = endingYAfter10Swaps - startingYAfter9Swaps;

        assertEq(expectedDeltaY ,actualDeltaY );
    }
```
</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** Remove the extra incentive , If you want to keep this in , we should account for the change in the `x * y = k` invariant.Or set aside some incentive from fees


## Medium

### [M-1] `TSwapPool::deposit` is missing deadline check causing transaction to be executed even after the deadline

**Description:** The `deposit` function takes a deadline as parameter which according to natspec , the transaction should be completed before the deadline but since the deadline parameter is never used , the transaction could be completed at an unfavourable or at volatile times or at undesired rates.

<!-- MEV attacks -->

**Impact:** Transactions could be sent when the market conditions are unfavourable to deposit even after adding the deadline paramter


**Proof of Code:** The `deadline` parameter is never used


**Recommended Mitigation:**

```diff
    function deposit(
        uint256 wethToDeposit,
        uint256 minimumLiquidityTokensToMint,
        uint256 maximumPoolTokensToDeposit,
        uint64 deadline
    )
        external
+       revertIfDeadlinePassed()deadline
        revertIfZero(wethToDeposit)
        returns (uint256 liquidityTokensToMint)
```
## Low

### [L-1] `TSwapPool::LiquidityAdded` event paramters are out of order.

**Description:** When the `LiquidityAdded` event is emitted in the `TSwapPool::_addLiquidityMintAndTransfer` function , it log values are in incorrect order. The `poolTokensToDeposit` value should go third while the `wethToDeposit` should go second.

**Impact:** Event emission is incorrect , leading to off-chain functions potentially malfunctioning

**Recommended Mitigation:**
```diff
-        emit LiquidityAdded(msg.sender, poolTokensToDeposit, wethToDeposit);
+       emit LiquidityAdded(msg.sender, wethToDeposit, poolTokensToDeposit);

```


### [L-2] Default value returned by `TSwapPool::swapExactInput` results in incorrect return value given

**Description:** The `swapExactInput` function is expected to return the actual amount of tokens bought by the msg.sender , however , the value returned by the function is never updated and hence returns the default value


**Impact:** The return value will always be zero , giving incorrect information

**Recommended Mitigation:**
```diff
{
        uint256 inputReserves = inputToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 outputReserves = outputToken.balanceOf(address(this));

-        uint256 outputAmount = getOutputAmountBasedOnInput(
+        uint256 output = getOutputAmountBasedOnInput(
            inputAmount,
            inputReserves,
            outputReserves
        );

-        if (outputAmount < minOutputAmount) {
+        if (output < minOutputAmount) {
            revert TSwapPool__OutputTooLow(outputAmount, minOutputAmount);
        }

-        _swap(inputToken, inputAmount, outputToken, outputAmount);
+        _swap(inputToken, inputAmount, outputToken, output);
    }
```


## Informational

### [I-1] `PoolFactory::PoolFactory__PoolDoesNotExist` is never used and should be removed

```diff
-    error PoolFactory__PoolDoesNotExist(address tokenAddress);
```

### [I-2] Lacking zero address check in `PoolFactory::constructor`

```diff
        constructor(address wethToken) {
+            if(wethToken == address(0)){
+                revert PoolFactory__ZeroAddressNotAllowed()
+            }
            i_wethToken = wethToken;
        }
```

### [I-3] `PoolFactory::constructor` should use `.symbol()` for `PoolFactory::liquidityTokenSymbol` instead of `.name()`

```diff
-   string memory liquidityTokenSymbol = string.concat("ts", IERC20(tokenAddress).name());
+   string memory liquidityTokenSymbol = string.concat("ts", IERC20(tokenAddress).symbol());
```

### [I-4] Event is missing 'indexed' fields

**Description:** Atleast 3 fields should be indexed in case an event has 3 or more than 3 fields.

### [I-5] Avoid using magic numbers instead use constant variables

### [I-6] Its better to follow CEI below

```diff
+        liquidityTokensToMint = wethToDeposit;

        _addLiquidityMintAndTransfer(
            wethToDeposit,
            maximumPoolTokensToDeposit,
            wethToDeposit
        );

-        liquidityTokensToMint = wethToDeposit;

```
### [I-7] `TSwapPool::swapExactInput` has no natspec , it should be there for function description


## Gas

### [G-1] `TSwapPool::MINIMUM_WETH_LIQUIDITY` can be omitted from events as its going to be same all the time which can save gas
```diff
        revert TSwapPool__WethDepositAmountTooLow(
-            MINIMUM_WETH_LIQUIDITY,
            wethToDeposit
        );

```
### [G-2] `poolTokenReserves` is never used in `TSwapPool::deposit` and can be removed

### [G-3] `TSwapPool::swapExactInput` should be an external function as it is not used inside the contract
